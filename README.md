# Album Manager

**A simple React application for managing albums.**

Album Collections is a web application that enables users to organize and interact with their photo albums. This project demonstrates basic album management features using React, including fetching albums from an API, adding new albums, updating existing ones, and deleting albums. Please note that the add, update, and delete operations are simulated (dummy requests) for demonstration purposes.
